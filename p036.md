In both solutions, the answer is computed from the sum of all base-ten
palindromes less than one million such that the number is also a a
palindrome in binary.

Note that we're not testing every number under a million. Instead,
we're testing every decimal palindrome under a million to see whether
it's also a binary palindrome. This speeds up the algorithm by a
factor of 500 (minus the overhead of palindrome generation), since
there are only 1998 palindromes under a million (in either binary or
decimal, of course).

About that figure, 1998. The even-length palindromes can be mapped
one-to-one to the integers under one thousand merely by taking the
right half of the digits. The odd-length palindromes map to the
even-length ones with a middle digit removed, which means there are
999 of each and 1998 palindromes in total.

The main differnce in the code here is that decimalPalindromes is
implemented by a generator function in python and a lazy stream in
scala. The complexity is similar, but the python implementation is a
bit more concise. I find the more declarative scala implementation
easier to understand, though it took a little bit more thinking to
write.
